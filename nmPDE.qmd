## Intro to PDEs

Partial differential equations (PDEs) are differential equations involving the partial derivatives of an unknown multivariable function. In most of this chapter we will examine two classical problems from physics: heat transport phenomena and wave phenomena. Do not think, however, that just because we are focusing on these two primary examples that this is the extent of the utility of PDEs. Basically, every scientific field has been impacted by (or has directly impacted) the study of PDEs. Any phenomenon that can be modelled via the change in multiple dimensions (and time) is likely governed by a PDE model. Some common phenomena that are modelled by PDEs are:

-   heat transport

    -   The heat equation models heat energy (temperature) diffusing through a metal rod or a solid body

-   diffusion of a concentrated substance

    -   The diffusion equation is a PDE model for the diffusion of smells, contaminants, or the motion of a solute

-   wave propagation

    -   The wave equation is a PDE that can be used to model the standing waves on a guitar string, the waves on lake, or sound waves traveling through the air

-   travelling waves

    -   The traveling wave equation is a PDE that can be used to model pulses of light propagating through a fiber optic cable or regions of high density traffic moving along a highway.

-   quantum mechanics

    -   The wave functions of quantum mechanics are described by a PDE called the Schrodinger Equation.

-   electro-magnetism

    -   Maxwell's Equations are a system of PDEs describing the relationships between electricity and magnetism.

-   fluid flow

    -   The Navier-Stokes equations are a system of PDEs that model fluids in three dimensions -- including turbulent flow.

    -   Darcy's Law and Richard's equation are PDE models for the motion of fluids moving through saturated and unsaturated soils.

-   stress and strain in structures

    -   The Linear Elasticity equation is a PDE that models the stresses in a solid body (like a bridge or a building) under load.

-   spatial patterns

    -   Solutions to the Helmholtz equation are known for exhibiting *Turing patterns* which are patterns like leopard spots or zebra stripes.

-   ... and many more ...

In many cases we are interested in solving PDEs in terms of our usual three spatial dimensions along with an extra dimension for time. Often we do not have to work with all three spatial dimensions (like if the domain is much larger in one or two directions versus the others) or in some cases (like in linear elasticity) we do not need to worry about time.

There is a wealth of wonderful theory for finding analytic solutions to many special classes of PDEs. However, most PDEs simply do not lend themselves to analytic solutions that we can write down in terms of the regular mathematical operations of sums, products, powers, roots, trigonometric functions, logarithms, etc. For these PDEs we must turn to numerical methods to approximate the solution.

Recall that numerical solutions to ODEs were approximations of the value of the unknown function at a discrete set of times. Similarly, numerical solutions to PDEs are going to be approximations of the value of the unknown function at a discrete set of points in time AND space.

What we will cover in this chapter will include one primary and powerful technique for approximating solutions to PDEs: **the finite difference method**. There are many other techniques for approximating solutions to PDEs, and the field of numerical PDEs is still an active area of mathematical and scientific research.


## The Heat Equation

You have probably met the heat equation, also known as the diffusion equation, in a previous module. The heat equation is a partial differential equation that describes how heat diffuses through a material. The heat equation is a parabolic PDE and is given by
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 u
$$
where $u(t,x)$ is the temperature of the material at time $t$ and position $x$ and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. The heat equation is a simple model for heat diffusion but also describes diffusion in general, like the diffusion of a solute in a solvent or of plants in a field or, .... well, you get the idea.

In the remainder of this section we will use a technique called **the finite difference method** to build numerical approximations to solutions of the heat equation in 1D, 2D, and 3D. You of course that the heat equation is easy to solve analytically, given that it is a linear homogeneous PDE with constant coefficients. However, the finite difference method is a powerful tool for solving similar PDEs that do not have simple analytic solutions. The advantage of using the heat equation as a test case for the finite difference method is that we can easily verify the accuracy of our numerical solutions by comparing them to the known analytic solutions.

### In One Spatial Dimensions {#sec-heat1d}

For the sake of simplicity we will start by considering the heat equation in 1 spatial dimension:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}. 
\end{equation}


::: {#exr-6.29}

Just as we did in [Chapter -@sec-calculus] to approximate derivatives and integrals numerically, and also in [Chapter -@sec-ode] to approximate solutions to ODEs, we will start by partitioning the domain into finitely many pieces and we will partition time into finitely many pieces. We do this by introducing a grid of points $(t_n,x_i)$ where $t_n = t_0 + n\,\Delta t$ and $x_i = x_0 + i\,\Delta x$.
Then we want to build a numerical approximation to the function $u(t,x)$ at these grid points. 

First we need to introduce some notation for the numerical solution. As you will see in a moment, there is a lot to keep track of in numerical PDEs so careful index and well-chosen notation is essential. Let $U_i^n$ be the approximation of the solution to $u(t,x)$ at the point $t=t_n=t_0+n\,\Delta t$ and $x=x_i=x_0+i\,\Delta x$ (since we have two variables we need to two indices). For example, $U_4^1$ is the value of the approximation at time $t_1$ and at the spatial point $x_4$.

Next we need to approximate both derivatives $u_t$ and $u_{xx}$ in the PDE using methods that we have used before. Now would be a good time to go back to [Chapter -@sec-calculus] and refresh your memory for how we build approximations of derivatives.

(a)  Use the forward-difference formula to approximate the time derivative $u_t$ at the point $t=t_n$ and $x=x_i$.
\begin{equation}
 u_t(t_n,x_i) \approx \frac{??? - ???}{???}. 
\end{equation}


(b)  Use the centred-difference formula to approximate the second spatial derivative $u_{xx}$ at the point $t=t_n$ and $x=x_i$.
\begin{equation}
 u_{xx}(t_n,x_i) \approx \frac{??? - ??? + ???}{???}.
\end{equation}


(c)  Put your answers from parts (a) and (b) together using the 1D heat equation 
\begin{equation}
\frac{??? - ???}{\Delta t} = D \left( \frac{??? - ??? + ???}{\Delta x^2} \right).
\end{equation}
 Be sure that your indexing is correct: the superscript $n$ is the index for time and the subscript $i$ is the index for space.

(d)  Rearrange your result from part (c) to solve for $U_i^{n+1}$: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} U_i^{n+1} = ??? + \frac{D \Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \left( ??? - ??? + ??? \right). \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
 The iterative scheme which you just derived is called a **finite difference scheme** for the heat equation. Notice that the term on the left is the only term at the next time step $n+1$. So, for every spatial point $x_i$ we can build $U_i^{n+1}$ by evaluating the right-hand side of the finite difference scheme.

(e)  The numerical errors made by using the finite difference scheme we just built come from two sources: from the approximation of the time derivative and from the approximation of the second spatial derivative. Fill in the question marks in the powers of the following expression: 
\begin{equation}
 \text{Numerical Error} = \mathcal{O}(\Delta t^{???}) + \mathcal{O}(\Delta x^{???}). 
\end{equation}

(f)  Explain what the result from part e means in plain English?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many different finite difference schemes due to the fact that there are many different ways to approximate derivatives (See [Chapter -@sec-calculus]). One convenient way to keep track of which information you are using and what you are calculating in a finite difference scheme is to use a **finite difference stencil image**. @fig-6.8 shows the finite difference stencil for the approximation to the heat equation that you built in the previous exercise. In this figure we are showing that the function values $U_{i-1}^n$, $U_i^n$, and $U_{i+1}^n$ at the points $x_{i-1}$, $x_i$, and $x_{i+1}$ are being used at time step $t_n$ to calculate $U_i^{n+1}$. We will build similar stencil diagrams for other finite difference schemes throughout this chapter.

Now we want to implement your answer to part (d) of the previous exercise to approximate the solution to the following problem: 
\begin{equation}
\text{Solve: } u_t = 0.01u_{xx}
\end{equation}
 with 
\begin{equation}
 x \in [0,1], \, u(0,x) = \sin(2 \pi x), \, u(t,0) = 0, \, \text{and} \, u(t,1) = 0.
\end{equation}
 Some partial code is given below to get you started.

-   First we import the proper libraries, set up the time domain, and set up the spatial domain.

``` python         
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ipywidgets import interactive

# Write code to give an array of times starting at t=0 and ending 
# at t=1.  Be sure that you use many points in the partition of 
# the time domain.  Be sure to either specify or calculate the 
# step size `dt`.

# Write code to give an array of x values starting at x=0 and 
# ending exactly at x=1. This is best done with the np.linspace() 
# command since you can guarantee that you end exactly at x=1.  
# Be sure to either specify or calculate the step size `dx`.

# The next two lines build two parameters that are of interest 
# for the finite difference scheme.
D = 0.01 # The diffusion coefficient for the heat equation given.
# The coefficient "a" appears in the finite difference scheme.
a = D*dt / dx**2 
print("dt=",dt,", dx=",dx," and D dt/dx^2=",a)
```

-   Next we build the array $U$ so we can store all of the approximations at all times and at all spatial points. The array will have the dimensions `len(t)` by `len(x)`. We then need to enforce the boundary conditions so for all times we fill the proper portions of the array with the proper boundary conditions. Lastly, we will build the initial condition for all spatial steps in the first time step.

``` python         
U = np.zeros((len(t),len(x)))
U[:,0] = # left boundary condition
U[:,-1] = # right boundary condition
U[0,:] = # the function for the init. condition (should depend on x)
```

-   Now we step through a loop that fills the $U$ array one row at a time. Keep in mind that we want to leave the boundary conditions fixed so we will only fill indices `1` through `-2` (stop and explain this). Be careful to get the indexing correct. For example, if we want $U_i^n$ we use `U[n,1:-1]`, if we want $U_{i+1}^n$ we use `U[n,2:]`, if we want $U_i^{n+1}$ we use `U[n+1,1:-1]`, etc.

``` python         
for n in range(len(t)-1):
    U[n+1,1:-1] = U[n,?:?] + a*( U[n,?:] - 2*U[n,?:?] + U[n,:?])
```

-   It remains to plot the solutions. One way to do this is with the `ipywidgets.interactive` tool. We first need to create a function which returns a plot at a particular time step. Then we call the function inside the `interactive` function. You could also use the `matplotlib.animation` function if you wish.

``` python         
def plotter(Frame):
    plt.plot(x,U[Frame,:],'b')
    plt.grid()
    plt.ylim(-1,1)
    plt.show()
interactive(plotter, Frame=(0,len(t)-1,1))
```
You can then look at the solution at different times by moving the slider above the plot.

You may have found that you did not get a sensible solution out for the previous problem. The point of this exercise is to show that value of $a = D\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}$ controls the stability of the finite difference solution to the heat equation, and furthermore that there is a cutoff for $a$ below which the finite difference scheme will be stable. Experiment with values of $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$ and conjecture the values of $a = D \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}$ that give a stable result. Your conjecture should take the form:

*If* $a = D\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} < \underline{\hspace{0.5in}}$ then the finite difference solution for the 1D heat equation is stable. Otherwise it is unstable.

Consider the one dimensional heat equation with diffusion coefficient $D=1$: 
\begin{equation}
 u_t = u_{xx}. 
\end{equation}
 We want to solve this equation on the domain $x \in [0,1]$ and $t\in [0,0.1]$ subject to the initial condition $u(0,x) = \sin(\pi x)$ and the boundary conditions $u(t,0)=u(t,1) = 0$.

(a)  Show that the function $u(t,x) = e^{-\pi^2 t} \sin(\pi x)$ is a solution to this heat equation, satisfies the initial condition, and satisfies the boundary conditions.

(b)  Pick values of $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$ so that you can get a stable finite difference solution to this heat equation. Then make a 3d plot of your numerical solution. To make the plot from your solution you can use the code
``` python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Surface(z=U, x=x, y=t)])
fig.update_layout(
    width=800, height=600,
    scene=dict(
        yaxis_title='t',
        zaxis_title='u'
    )
)
```
Does your numerical solution appear to match the analytic solution from part (a)?

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.32b}
Now let us change the initial condition to $u(0,x)=\sin(\pi x) + \sin(3 \pi x)$. We will keep the same boundary conditions as before: $u(t,0)=u(t,1)=0$.

(a)   Show that the function $u(t,x) = e^{-\pi^2 t} \sin(\pi x) +  e^{-9\pi^2t}\sin(3\pi x)$ is a solution to this heat equation, matches this new initial condition, and matches the boundary conditions.

(b)  Pick values of $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$ so that you can get a stable finite difference solution to this heat equation. Make a 3d plot of your numerical solution.

(c) Compare your plot to the plot of the exact solution that you can get with
``` python
X, T = np.meshgrid(x, t)
u_exact = np.exp(-np.pi**2*T)*np.sin(np.pi*X)+np.exp(-9*np.pi**2*T)*np.sin(3*np.pi*X)

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Surface(z=u_exact, x=x, y=t)])
fig.update_layout(
    title='Exact Solution',
    width=800, height=600,
    scene=dict(
        yaxis_title='t',
        zaxis_title='u'
    )
)
```

::: {#exr-6.33}
In any initial and boundary value problem such as the heat equation, the boundary are often of Dirichlet or Neumann type. In Dirichlet boundary conditions the values of the solution at the boundary are specified. So far we have only solved the heat equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In contrast, Neumann boundary conditions specify the flux at the boundary instead of the value of the solution. 

Consider the 1D heat equation $u_t = u_{xx}$ with boundary conditions $u_x(t,0)=0$ and $u(t,1)=0$ with initial condition $u(0,x) = \cos(\pi x/2)$. Notice that the initial condition satisfies both boundary conditions: $\frac{d}{dx}(\cos(\pi \cdot x/2))\Big|_{x=0} = 0$ and $\cos(\pi \cdot 1/2)=0$. As the heat profile evolves in time the Neumann boundary condition $u_x(t,0)=0$ says that the slope of the solution needs to be fixed at 0 at the left-hand boundary.

(a)  Draw several images of what the solution to the PDE should look like as time evolves. Be sure that all boundary conditions are satisfied and that your solution appears to solve the heat equation.

(b)  The Neumann boundary condition $u_x(t,0) = 0$ can be approximated with the first order approximation 
\begin{equation}
 u_x(t_n,0) \approx \frac{U_1^n - U_0^n}{\Delta x}. 
\end{equation}
 If we set this approximation to 0 (since $u_x(t,0)=0$) and solve for $U_0^n$ we get an additional constraint at every time step of the numerical solution to the heat equation. What is this new equation.

(c)  Modify your 1D heat equation code to implement this Neumann boundary condition, plot the numerical solution and verify visually that the Neumann boundary is satisfied.

### In Two Spatial Dimensions {#sec-heat2d}

Now we transition to the two dimensional heat equation. Instead of thinking of this as heating a long metal rod we can think of heating a thin plate of metal (like a flat cookie sheet). The heat equation models the propagation of the heat energy throughout the 2D surface. In two spatial dimensions the heat equation is 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right),
\end{equation}
 or, using subscript notation for the partial derivatives, 
\begin{equation}
 u_t = D\left( u_{xx} + u_{yy} \right). 
\end{equation}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.35}
Let us build a numerical solution to the 2D heat equation. We need to make a minor modification to our notation since there is now one more spatial dimension to keep track of. Let $U_{i,j}^n$ be the approximation to $u$ at the point $(t_n, x_i, y_j)$. For example, $U_{2,3}^4$ will be the approximation to the solution at the point $(t_4,x_2,y_3)$.

(a)  We already know how to approximate the time derivative in the heat equation: 
\begin{equation}
 u_t(t_{n}, x_i, y_j) \approx \frac{U_{i,j}^{n+1} - U_{i,j}^n}{\Delta t}. 
\end{equation}
 The new challenge now is that we have two spatial partial derivatives: one in $x$ and one in $y$. Use what you learned in [Chapter -@sec-calculus] to write the approximations of $u_{xx}$ and $u_{yy}$. 
\begin{equation}
 u_{xx}(t_n,x_i,y_j) \approx \frac{??? - ??? + ???}{\Delta x^2} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 u_{yy}(t_n,x_i,y_j) \approx \frac{??? - ??? + ???}{\Delta y^2} 
\end{equation}
 Take careful note that the index $i$ is the only one that changes for the $x$ derivative. Similarly, the index $j$ is the only one that changes for the $y$ derivative.

(b)  Put your answers to part (a) together with the 2D heat equation 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{U_{i,j}^{n+1} - U_{i,j}^n}{\Delta t} = D \left( \frac{??? - ??? + ???}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{??? - ??? + ???}{\Delta y^2} \right). 
\end{equation}


(c)  Let us make one simplifying assumption. Choose the partition of the domain so that $\Delta x = \Delta y$. Note that we can usually do this in square domains. In more complicated domains we will need to be more careful. Simplify the right-hand side of your answer to part (b) under this assumption. 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{U_{i,j}^{n+1} - U_{i,j}^n}{\Delta t} = D \left( \frac{??? + ??? - ??? + ??? + ???}{???} \right). 
\end{equation}


(d)  Now solve your result from part (c) for $U_{i,j}^{n+1}$. Your answer is the explicit finite difference scheme for the 2D heat equation. 
\begin{equation}
 U_{i,j}^{n+1} = U_{???,???}^{???} + \frac{D \cdot ???}{???} \left( ??? + ??? - ??? + ??? + ??? \right) 
\end{equation}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The finite difference stencil for the 2D heat equation is a bit more complicated since we now have three indices to track. Hence, the stencil is naturally three dimensional. @fig-6.9 shows the stencil for the finite difference scheme that we built in the previous exercise. The left-hand subplot in the figure shows the five points used in time step $t_n$, and the right-hand subplot shows the one point that is calculated at time step $t_{n+1}$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.36}
Now we need to implement the finite difference scheme that you developed in the previous problem. As a model problem, consider the 2D heat equation $u_t = D(u_{xx} + u_{yy})$ on the domain $(x,y) \in [0,1] \times [0,1]$ with the initial condition $u(0,x,y) = \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)$, Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(t,x,0) = u(t,x,1)=u(t,0,y)=u(t,1,y)=0$, and $D=1$. Fill in the holes in the following code chunks.

-   First we import the proper libraries and set up the domains for $x$, $y$, and $t$.
``` python         
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import cm # this allows for color maps 
from ipywidgets import interactive

# Write code to build a linearly spaced array of x values 
# starting at 0 and ending at exactly 1
x = # your code here
y = x # this could be generalised later
# The consequence of the previous line is that dy = dx.
dx = # Extract dx from your array of x values.
# Now write code to build a linearly spaced array of time values 
# starting at 0 and ending at 0.1.
# You will want to use many more values for time than for space 
# (think about the stability conditions from the 1D heat equation).
t = # your code here
dt = # Extract dt from your array of t values

# Next we will use the np.meshgrid() command to turn the arrays of 
# x and y values into 2D grids of x and y values.  
# If you match the corresponding entries of X and Y then you get 
# every ordered pair in the domain.
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x,y)

# Next we set up a 3 dimensional array of zeros to store all of 
# the time steps of the solutions.
U = np.zeros((len(t), len(x), len(y)))
```

-   Next we have to set up the boundary and initial conditions for the given problem.
``` python         
U[0,:,:] = # initial condition depending on X and Y
U[:,0,:] = # boundary condition for x=0
U[:,-1,:] = # boundary condition for x=1
U[:,:,0] = # boundary condition for y=0
U[:,:,-1] = # boundary condition for y=1
```

-   We know that the value of $D \Delta t / \Delta x^2$ controls the stability of finite element methods. Therefore, the next step in our code is to calculate this value and print it.
``` python         
D = 1
a = D*dt/dx**2
print(a)
```

-   Next for the part of the code that actually calculates all of the time steps. Be sure to keep the indexing straight. Also be sure that we are calculating all of the spatial indices *inside* the domain since the boundary conditions dictate what happens on the boundary.
``` python         
for n in range(len(t)-1):
  U[n+1,1:-1,1:-1] = U[n,1:-1,1:-1] + \
    a*(U[n, ?:? , ?:?] + \
       U[n, ?:?, ?:?] - \
       4*U[n, ?:?, ?:?] + \
       U[n, ?:?, ?:?] + \
       U[n, ?:?, ?:?])
```

-   Finally, we just need to visualize the solution. Again we use the `ipywidgets.interactive` tool to build an interactive plot with time as the slider.
``` python         
def plotter(Frame):
  fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,10))
  ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
  ax.plot_surface(X,Y,U[Frame,:,:], cmap=cm.coolwarm)
  ax.set_zlim(0,1)
  plt.show()

interactive(plotter, Frame=(0,len(t)))
```

Fill in all of the holes in the code and verify that your solution appears to solve a heat dissipation problem.

### Stability and Implicit Methods {#sec-heat_stability}

::: {#exr-6.39}
#### Sawtooth Errors
We have already seen that the 1D heat equation is stable if $D \Delta t / \Delta x^2 < 0.5$. The goal of this problem is to show what, exactly, occurs when we choose parameters in the unstable region. We will solve the PDE $u_t = u_{xx}$ on the domain $x \in [0,1]$ with initial conditions $u(0,x) = \sin(\pi x)$ and boundary conditions $u(t,0)=u(t,1)=0$ for all $t\in[0,0.25]$. The analytic solution is $u(t,x) = e^{-\pi^2 t}\sin(\pi x)$. To build the spatial and temporal grid we will use `x = np.linspace(0,1,21)` and `t = np.linspace(0,0.25,101)`. This means that $\Delta x = 0.05$ and $\Delta t = 0.0025$ so the ratio $D \Delta t / \Delta x^2 = 1 > 0.5$ (certainly in the unstable region). Solve the heat equation with finite differences using these parameters. Make plots of the approximate solution on top of the exact solution at time steps 0, 10, 20, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, etc. Describe what you observe.

Let us summarize the stability criteria for the finite difference solutions to the heat equation.

-   In the 1D heat equation the finite difference solution is stable if $D \Delta t / \Delta x^2 < \underline{\hspace{0.5in}}$.

-   In the 2D heat equation the finite difference solution is stable if $D \Delta t / \Delta x^2 < \underline{\hspace{0.5in}}$ (assuming a square domain where $\Delta x = \Delta y$)

-   Conjecture a stability criterion for the 3D heat equation.

::: {#exr-6.42}
Rewrite your finite difference code so that it produces an error message when the parameters will result in an unstable finite difference solution. Do the same for your 2D heat equation code.

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is actually possible to beat the stability criteria given in the previous exercises! What follows are two implicit methods that use a forward-looking scheme to help completely avoid unstable solutions. The primary advantage to these schemes is that we will not need to pay as close attention to the ratio of the time step to the square of the spatial step. Instead, we can take time and spatial steps that are appropriate for the application we have in mind.

#### Implicit Finite Difference Scheme
For the 1D heat equation $u_t = D u_{xx}$ we have been finding the numerical solution using the explicit finite difference scheme 
\begin{equation}
\frac{U_i^{n+1} - U_i^n}{\Delta t} = D \frac{U_{i+1}^{n} - 2U_i^{n} + U_{i-1}^{n}}{\Delta x^2}
\end{equation}
 where we approximate the time derivative with the usual forward difference and we approximate the spatial derivative with the usual centred difference. If, however, we use the spatial derivative at time step $n+1$ instead of time step $n$ we get the finite difference scheme 
\begin{equation}
\frac{U_i^{n+1} - U_i^n}{\Delta t} = D \frac{U_{i+1}^{n+1} - 2U_i^{n+1} + U_{i-1}^{n+1}}{\Delta x^2}.
\end{equation}
 This may seem completely ridiculous since we do not yet know the information at time step $n+1$ but some algebraic rearrangement shows that we can treat this as a system of linear equations which can be solved (using something like `np.linalg.solve()`) for the $(n+1)^{st}$ time step.

Before we start let us define the coefficient $a = D \Delta t / \Delta x^2.$ This will save a little bit of writing in the coming steps.

1.  Rearrange the new finite difference scheme so that all of the terms at the $(n+1)^{st}$ time step are on the left-hand side and all of the term at the $n^{th}$ time step are on the right-hand side. 
\begin{equation}
(\underline{\hspace{0.25in}}) U_{i-1}^{n+1} + (\underline{\hspace{0.5in}}) U_{i}^{n+1} + (\underline{\hspace{0.25in}}) U_{i+1}^{n+1} = \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_i^n
\end{equation}


2.  Now we are going to build a very small example with only 6 spatial points so that you can clearly see the structure of the resulting linear system.

    1.  If we have 6 total points in the spatial grid ($x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_5$) then we have the following equations (fill in the blanks): 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} (\text{for $x_1$: }) \quad \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_0^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.5in}} U_1^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_2^{n+1} &= \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_1^{n} \\ (\text{for $x_2$: }) \quad \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_1^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.5in}} U_2^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_3^{n+1} &= \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_2^{n} \\ (\text{for $x_3$: }) \quad \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_2^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.5in}} U_3^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_4^{n+1} &= \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_3^{n} \\ (\text{for $x_4$: }) \quad \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_3^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.5in}} U_4^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_5^{n+1} &= \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_4^{n} \\ \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


    2.  Notice that we aready know $U_0^{n+1}$ and $U_5^{n+1}$ since these are dictated by the boundary conditions (assuming Dirichlet boundary conditions). Hence we can move these known quantities to the right-hand side of the equations and hence rewrite the system of equations as: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} 
(\text{for $x_1$: }) &\quad \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_1^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.5in}} U_2^{n+1} = \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_1^{n} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_0^{n+1}\\ 
(\text{for $x_2$: }) &\quad \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_1^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.5in}} U_2^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_3^{n+1} = \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_2^{n} \\ (\text{for $x_3$: }) &\quad \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_2^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.5in}} U_3^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_4^{n+1} = \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_3^{n} \\ (\text{for $x_4$: }) &\quad \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_3^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.5in}} U_4^{n+1} = \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_4^{n} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_5^{n+1} \\ \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


    3.  Now we can leverage linear algebra and write this as a matrix equation. 
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} & \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} & 0 & 0 \\ \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} & \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} & \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} & 0 \\ 0 & \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} & \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} & \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} \\ 0 & 0 & \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} & \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} U_1^{n+1} \\ U_2^{n+1} \\ U_3^{n+1} \\ U_4^{n+1} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} U_1^{n} \\ U_2^{n} \\ U_3^{n} \\ U_4^{n} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_0^{n+1} \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_5^{n+1} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}


3.  At this point the structure of the coefficient matrix on the left and the vector sum on the right should be clear (even for more spatial points). It is time for us to start writing some code. we will start with the basic setup of the problem.

``` python         
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

D = 1
x = # set up a linearly spaced spatial domain 
t = # set up a linearly spaced temporal domain
dx = x[1]-x[0]
dt = t[1]-t[0]
a = D*dt/dx**2
IC = lambda x: # write a function for the initial condition
BCleft = lambda t: 0*t # left boundary condition 
# (we have used 0*t here for a homog. bc)
BCright = lambda t: 0*t # right boundary condition 
# (we have used 0*t here for a homog. bc)

U = np.zeros( ( len(t), len(x) ) ) # set up a blank array for U
U[0,:] = IC(x) # set up the initial condition
U[:,0] = BCleft(t) # set up the left boundary condition
U[:,-1] = BCright(t) # set up the right boundary condition
```

4.  Next we write a function that takes in the number of spatial points and returns the coefficient matrix for the linear system. Take note that the first and last rows take a little more care than the rest.

``` python         
def coeffMatrix(M,a): # we are using M=len(x) as the first input
  A = np.matrix( np.zeros( (M-2,M-2) ) ) 
  # why are we using M-2 X M-2 for the size?
  A[0,0] = # top left entry
  A[0,1] = # entry in the first row second column
  A[-1,-1] = # bottom right entry
  A[-1,-2] = # entry in the last row second to last column
  for i in range(1,M-3): # now loop through all of the other rows
    A[i,i] = # entry on the main diagonal
    A[i,i-1] = # entry on the lower diagonal
    A[i,i+1] = # entry on the upper diagonal
  return A

A = coeffMatrix(len(x),a)
print(A)
plt.spy(A) 
# spy is a handy plotting tool that shows the structure 
# of a matrix (optional)
plt.show()
```

5.  Next we write a loop that iteratively solves the system of equations for each new time step.

``` python         
for n in range(len(t)-1):
  b1 = U[n,???] 
  # b1 is a vector of U at step n for the inner spatial nodes
  b2 = np.zeros_like(b1) # set up the second right-hand vector
  b2[0] = ???*BCleft(t[n+1]) # fill in the correct first entry
  b2[-1] = ???*BCright(t[n+1]) # fill in the correct last entry
  b = b1 + b2 # The vector "b" is the right side of the equation
  # 
  # finally use a linear algebra solver to fill in the 
  # inner spatial nodes at step n+1
  U[n+1,???] = ???
```

6.  All of the hard work is now done. It remains to plot the solution. Try this method on several sets of initial and boundary conditions for the 1D heat equation. Be sure to demonstrate that the method is stable no matter the values of $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$.

7.  What are the primary advantages and disadvantages to the implicit method described in this problem?

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.44}
#### The Crank-Nicolson Method
We conclude this section with one more implicit scheme: the **Crank-Nicolson Method**. In this method we approximate the temporal derivative with a forward difference just like always, but we approximate the spatial derivative as the average of the central difference at the current time step and the central difference at the new time step. That is: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{U_i^{n+1} - U_i^n}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{2} \left[D \left( \frac{U_{i-1}^n - 2U_i^n + U_{i+1}^n}{\Delta x^2}\right) +D \left(\frac{U_{i-1}^{n+1} - 2U_i^{n+1} + U_{i+1}^{n+1}}{\Delta x^2} \right) \right].
\end{equation}
 Letting $r = D \Delta t / (2\Delta x^2)$ we can rearrange to get 
\begin{equation}
\underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_{i-1}^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_{i}^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_{i+1}^{n+1} = \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_{i-1}^{n} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_{i}^{n} + \underline{\hspace{0.25in}} U_{i+1}^{n}.
\end{equation}
 This can now be viewed as a system of equations. Let us build this system carefully and then write code to solve the heat equation from the previous problems with the Crank-Nicolson method. For this problem we will assume fixed Dirichlet boundary conditions on both the left- and right-hand sides of the domain.

1.  First let us write the equations for several values of $i$. 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} (\text{$x_1$ }): \quad \underline{\hspace{0.15in}} U_0^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}} U^{n+1}_1 + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}} U^{n+1}_2 &= \underline{\hspace{0.15in}}U^n_0 + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}} U^n_1 + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}}U^n_2 \\ (\text{$x_2$ }): \quad \underline{\hspace{0.15in}} U_1^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}} U^{n+1}_2 + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}}U^{n+1}_3 &= \underline{\hspace{0.15in}}U^n_1 + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}} U^n_2 + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}}U^n_3 \\ (\text{$x_3$ }): \quad \underline{\hspace{0.15in}} U_2^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}} U^{n+1}_3 + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}}U^{n+1}_4 &= \underline{\hspace{0.15in}}U^n_2 + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}} U^n_3 + \underline{\hspace{0.15in}}U^n_4 \\ \qquad \vdots & \qquad \vdots \\ (\text{$x_{M-2}$ }): \quad \underline{\hspace{0.1in}} U_{M-3}^{n+1} + \underline{\hspace{0.1in}} U^{n+1}_{M-2} + \underline{\hspace{0.1in}}U^{n+1}_{M-1} &= \underline{\hspace{0.1in}}U^n_{M-3} + \underline{\hspace{0.1in}} U^n_{M-2} + \underline{\hspace{0.1in}}U^n_{M-1} \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
 where $M$ is the number of spatial points (enumerated $x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{M-1}$).

2.  The first and last equations can be simplified since we are assuming that we have Dirichlet boundary conditions. Therefore for $x_1$ we can rearrange to move the $U_0^{n+1}$ term to the right-hand side since it is given for all time. Similarly for $x_{M-2}$ we can move the $U_{M-1}^{n+1}$ term to the right-hand side since it is fixed for all time. Rewrite these two equations.

3.  Verify that the left-hand side of the equations that we have built in parts (a) and (b) can be written as the following matrix-vector product: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} \begin{pmatrix} (1+2r) & -r & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ -r & (1+2r) & -r & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & -r & (1+2r) & -r & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & & & & & 0 \\ 0 & \cdots & & 0 & -r & (1+2r) \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} U^{n+1}_1 \\ U^{n+1}_2 \\ U^{n+1}_3 \\ \vdots \\U^{n+1}_{M-2} \end{pmatrix} \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


4.  Verify that the right-hand side of the equations that we built in parts (a) and (b) can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} \begin{pmatrix} (1-2r) & r & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ r & (1-2r) & r & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & r & (1-2r) & r & & 0 \\ \vdots & & & & & \\ & & & & r & (1-2r) \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} U^{n}_1 \\ U^{n}_2 \\ U_3^n \\ \vdots \\U^{n}_{M-2} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} rU_0^{n+1} \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ rU_{M-1}^{n+1} \end{pmatrix} \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


5.  Now for the wonderful part! The entire system of equations from part (a) can be written as 
\begin{equation}
A \mathcal{U}^{n+1} = B \mathcal{U}^n + D.
\end{equation}
 What are the matrices $A$ and $B$ and what are the vectors $\mathcal{U}^{n+1}$, $\mathcal{U}^n$, and $D$?

6.  To solve for $\mathcal{U}^{n+1}$ at each time step we simply need to do a linear solve: 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}^{n+1} = A^{-1} \left( B \mathcal{U}^n + D \right).
\end{equation}
 Of course, we will never do a matrix inverse on a computer. Instead we can lean on tools such as `np.linalg.solve()` to do the linear solve for us.

7.  Finally. Write code to solve the 1D Heat Equation implementing the Crank Nicolson method described in this problem. The setup of your code should be largely the same as for the implicit method from @exr-6.43. You will need to construct the matrices $A$ and $B$ as well as the vector $D$. Then your time stepping loop will contain the code from part 6 of this problem.

## The Wave Equation

The problems that we have dealt with thus far all model natural diffusion processes: heat transport, molecular diffusion, etc. Another interesting physical phenomenon is that of wave propagation. The 1D *wave equation* is 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} u_{tt} = c u_{xx} \label{eqn:wave1D} \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
 where $c$ is a parameter modelling the stiffness of the medium the wave is travelling through. With homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions we can think of this as the behaviour of a guitar string after it has been plucked. If the boundaries are in motion then the model might be of someone wiggling a taught string from one end.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.46}
Let us write code to numerically solve the 1D wave equation. As before, we use the notation $U_i^n$ to represent the approximate solution $u(t,x)$ at the point $t=t_n$ and $x=x_i$.

1.  Give a reasonable discretization of the second derivative in time: 
\begin{equation}
 u_{tt}(t_{n}, x_i) \approx \underline{\hspace{1in}}. 
\end{equation}


2.  Give a reasonable discretization of the second derivative in space: 
\begin{equation}
 u_{xx}(t_n, x_i) \approx \underline{\hspace{1in}}. 
\end{equation}


3.  Put your answers to parts (a) and (b) together with the wave equation to get 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{??? - ??? + ???}{\Delta t^2} = c \frac{??? - ??? + ???}{\Delta x^2}. 
\end{equation}


4.  Solve the equation from part 3 for $U_i^{n+1}$. The resulting difference equation is the finite difference scheme for the 1D wave equation.

5.  You should notice that the finite difference scheme for the wave equation references two different times: $U_i^n$ and $U_i^{n-1}$. Based on this observation, what information do we need to in order to actually start our numerical solution?

6.  Consider the wave equation $u_{tt} = 2 u_{xx}$ in $x \in (0,1)$ with $u(0,x) = 4x(1-x)$, $u_t(0,x) = 0$, and $u(t,0) = u(t,1) = 0$. Use the finite difference scheme that you built in this problem to approximate the solution to this PDE.

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

@fig-6.11 shows the finite difference stencil for the 1D wave equation. Notice that we need two prior time steps in order to advance to the new time step. This means that in order to start the finite difference scheme for the wave equation we need to have information about time $t_0$ and also time $t_1$. We get this information by using the two initial conditions $u(0,x)$ and $u_t(0,x)$.

::: {#exr-6.47}
The ratio $c\Delta t^2 / \Delta x^2$ shows up explicitly in the finite difference scheme for the 1D wave equation. Just like in the heat equation, this parameter controls when the finite difference solution will be stable. Experiment with your finite difference solution and conjecture a value of $a = c \Delta t^2 / \Delta x^2$ which divides the regions of stability versus instability. Your answer should be in the form:

*If* $a = c\Delta t^2 / \Delta x^2 < \underline{\hspace{0.5in}}$ then the finite difference scheme for the 1D wave equation will be stable. Otherwise it will be unstable.

::: {#exr-6.52}
Now consider the 2D wave equation 
\begin{equation}
 u_{tt} = c\left( u_{xx} + u_{yy} \right).

1.  Give discretizations of the derivatives $u_{tt}$, $u_{xx}$, and $u_{yy}$.

2.  Substitute your discretizations into the 2D wave equation, make the simplifying assumption that $\Delta x = \Delta y$, and solve for $U_{i,j}^{n+1}$. This is the finite difference scheme for the 2D wave equation.

## The Travelling Wave Equation

Now we turn our attention to a new PDE: the transport equation 
\begin{equation}
 u_t + v u_x = 0. 
\end{equation}

 In this equation $u(t,x)$ is the height of a wave at time $t$ and spatial location $x$. The parameter $v$ is the velocity of the wave. Imagine this as sending a single solitary wave pulsing down a taught rope or as sending a single pulse of light down a fibre optic cable.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.55}
Consider the PDE $u_t + v u_x = 0$. There is a very easy way to get an analytic solution to this equation that describes a travelling wave. If we have the initial condition $u(0,x) = f(x) = e^{-(x-4)^2}$ then we claim that $u(t,x) = f(x-vt)$ is an analytic solution to the PDE. More explicitly, we are claiming that 
\begin{equation}
 u(t,x) = e^{-(x-vt-4)^2} 
\end{equation}
 is the analytic solution to the PDE. Let us prove this.

1.  Take the $t$ derivative of $u(t,x)$.

2.  Take the $x$ derivative of $u(t,x)$.

3.  The PDE claims that $u_t + vu_x = 0$. Verify that this equal sign is indeed true.

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.56}
Now we would like to visualize the solution to the PDE from the previous exercise. The Python code below gives an interactive visual of the solution. Experiment with different values of $v$ and different initial conditions.

``` python         
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

v = 1
f = lambda x: np.exp(-(x-4)**2)

  return (frame,)

PlotFrames = range(0,len(t),1)

                               animator, 
                               frames=PlotFrames, 
                               interval=100, 
                              )

rc('animation', html='jshtml') # embed in the HTML for Google Colab
anim
```

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.57}
Use the chain rule to prove that for any differentiable function $f(x)$ the function $u(t,x) = f(x-vt)$ is an analytic solution to the transport equation $u_t + v u_{x} = 0$ with initial condition $u(0,x) = f(x)$.

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus the travelling wave equation $u_t + vu_x = 0$ has a very nice analytic solution which we can always find. Therefore there is no need to ever find a numerical solution -- we can just write down the analytic solution if we are given the initial condition. As it turns out though, the numerical solutions exhibit some very interesting behaviour.

Consider the travelling wave equation $u_t + vu_x = 0$ with initial condition $u(0,x) = f(x)$ for some given function $f$ and boundary condition $u(t,0) = 0$. To build a numerical solution we will again adopt the notation $U_i^n$ for the approximation to $u(t,x)$ at the point $t=t_n$ and $x=x_i$.

(a)  Write an approximation of $u_t$ using $U_i^{n+1}$ and $U_i^n$.

(b)  Write an approximation of $u_x$ using $U_{i+1}^n$ and $U_i^n$.

(c)  Substitute your answers from parts (a) and (b) into the travelling wave equation and solve for $U_i^{n+1}$. This is our first finite difference scheme for the travelling wave equation.

(d)  Write Python code to get the finite difference approximation of the solution to the PDE. Plot your finite difference solution on top of the analytic solution for $f(x) = e^{-(x-4)^2}$. What do you notice? Can you stabilize this method by changing the values of $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$ like with did with the heat and wave equations?

The finite difference scheme that you built in the previous exercise is called the downwind scheme for the travelling wave equation. @fig-6.12 shows the finite difference stencil for this scheme. We call this scheme "downwind" since we expect the wave to travel from left to right and we can think of a fictitious wind blowing the solution from left to right. Notice that we are using information from "downwind" of the point at the new time step.

You should have noticed in the previous exercise that you cannot reasonably stabilize the finite difference scheme. Propose several reasons why this method appears to be unstable no matter what you use for the ratio $v \Delta t / \Delta x$.

::: {#exr-6.60}
One of the troubles with the finite difference scheme that we have built for the travelling wave equation is that we are using the information at our present spatial location and the next spatial location to the right to propagate the solution forward in time. The trouble here is that the wave is moving from left to right, so the interesting information about the next time step's solution is actually coming from the left, not the right. We call this "looking upwind" since you can think of a fictitious *wind* blowing from left to right, and we need to look "upwind" to see what is coming at us. If we write the spatial derivative as 
\begin{equation}
 u_x \approx \frac{U_i^n - U_{i-1}^n}{\Delta x} 
\end{equation}
 we still have a first-order approximation of the derivative but we are now looking left instead of right for our spatial derivative. Make this modification in your finite difference code for the travelling wave equation (call it the "upwind method"). Approximate the solution to the same PDE as we worked with in the previous exercises. What do you notice now?

@fig-6.13 shows the finite difference stencil for the upwind scheme. We call this scheme "up" since we expect the wave to travel from left to right and we can think of a fictitious wind blowing the solution from left to right. Notice that we are using information from "upwind" of the point at the new time step.

Neither the downwind nor the upwind solutions for the travelling wave equation are satisfactory. They completely miss the interesting dynamics of the analytic solution to the PDE. Some ideas for stabilizing the finite difference solution for the travelling wave equation are as follows. Implement each of these ideas and discuss pros and cons of each. Also draw a finite difference stencil for each of these methods.

1.  Perhaps one of the issues is that we are using first-order methods to approximate $u_t$ and $u_x$. What if we used a second-order approximation for these first derivatives 
\begin{equation}
 u_t \approx \frac{U_i^{n+1} - U_i^{n-1}}{2\Delta t} \quad \text{ and } \quad u_x \approx \frac{U_{i+1}^n - U_{i-1}^n}{2\Delta x}? 
\end{equation}
 Solve for $U_i^{n+1}$ and implement this method. This is called the **leapfrog method.**

2.  For this next method let us stick with the second-order approximation of $u_x$ but we will do something clever for $u_t$. For the time derivative we originally used 
\begin{equation}
 u_t \approx \frac{U_i^{n+1} - U_i^n}{\Delta t} 
\end{equation}
 what happens if we replace $U_i^n$ with the average value from the two surrounding spatial points 
\begin{equation}
 U_i^n \approx \frac{1}{2} \left( U_{i+1}^n + U_{i-1}^n \right)? 
\end{equation}
 This would make our approximation of the time derivative 
\begin{equation}
 u_t \approx \frac{U_i^{n+1} - \frac{1}{2} \left( U_{i+1}^n + U_{i-1}^n \right)}{\Delta t}. 
\end{equation}
 Solve this modified finite difference equation for $U_i^{n+1}$ and implement this method. This is called the **Lax-Friedrichs** method.

3.  Finally we will do something very clever (and very counter intuitive). What if we inserted some artificial diffusion into the problem? You know from your work with the heat equation that diffusion spreads a solution out. The downwind scheme seemed to have the issue that it was *bunching up* at the beginning and end of the wave, so artificial diffusion might smooth this out. The **Lax-Wendroff method** does exactly that: take a regular Euler-type step in time 
\begin{equation}
 u_t \approx \frac{U_i^{n+1} - U_i^n}{\Delta t}, 
\end{equation}
 use a second-order centred difference scheme in space to approximate $u_x$ 
\begin{equation}
 u_x \approx \frac{U_{i+1}^n - U_{i-1}^n}{2\Delta x}, 
\end{equation}
 but add on the term 
\begin{equation}
 \left( \frac{v^2 \Delta t^2}{2\Delta x^2} \right) \left( U_{i-1}^n - 2 U_i^n + U_{i+1}^n \right) 
\end{equation}
 to the right-hand side of the equation. Notice that this new term is a scalar multiple of the second-order approximation of the second derivative $u_{xx}$. Solve this equation for $U_i^{n+1}$ and implement the Lax-Wendroff method.

Next we will examine 2D steady state heat profiles. Consider the PDE $u_t = u_{xx} + u_{yy}$ with boundary conditions $u(t,0,y) = u(t,x,0) = u(t,x,1) = 0$ and $u(t,1,y) = 1$ with initial condition $u(0,x,y) = 0$.

Now consider the forced 2D heat equation $u_t = u_{xx} + u_{yy} + 10e^{-(x-0.5)^2-(y-0.5)^2}$ with the same boundary and initial conditions as the previous exercise. The exponential forcing function introduced in this equation is an external source of heat (like a flame held to the middle of the metal sheet).

1.  Conjecture what the steady state heat profile will look like for this particular setup. Be able to defend your answer.

2.  Modify your 2D heat equation code to show the full time evolution of this PDE. Run the simulation long enough so that you see the steady state heat profile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Up to this point we have studied PDEs that all depend on time. In many applications, however, we are not interested in the transient (time dependent) behaviour of a system. Instead we are often interested in the steady state solution when the forces in question are in static equilibrium. Two very famous time-independent PDEs are the Laplace Equation 
\begin{equation}
 u_{xx} + u_{yy} + u_{zz} = 0 
\end{equation}
 and the Poisson equation 
\begin{equation}
 u_{xx} + u_{yy} + u_{zz} = f(x,y,z). 
\end{equation}
 Notice that both the Laplace and Poisson equations are the equations that we get when we consider the limit $u_t \to 0$. In the limit when the time rate of change goes to zero we are actually just looking at the eventual steady state heat profile resulting from the initial and boundary conditions of the heat equation. In the previous exercises you already wrote code that will show the steady state profiles in a few setups. The trouble with the approach of letting the time-dependent simulation run for a *long time* is that the finite difference solution for the heat equation is known to have stability issues. Moreover, it may take a lot of computational time for the solution to reach the eventual steady state. In the remainder of this section we look at methods of solving for the steady state directly -- without examining any of the transient behaviour. We will first examine a 1D version of the Laplace and Poisson equations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.67}
Consider a 1-dimensional rod that is infinitely thin and has unit length. For the sake of simplicity assume the following:

-   the specific heat of the rod is exactly 1 for the entire length of the rod,

-   the temperature of the left end is held fixed at $u(0) = 0$,

-   the temperature of the right end is held fixed at $u(1) = 1$, and

-   the temperature has reached a steady state.

You can assume that the temperatures are *reference temperatures* instead of absolute temperatures, so a temperature of "0" might represent room temperature.

Since there are no external sources of heat we model the steady-state heat profile we must have $u_t = 0$ in the heat equation. Thus the heat equation collapses to $u_{xx} = 0$. This is exactly the one dimensional Laplace equation.

(a)  To get an exact solution of the Laplace equation in this situation we simply need to integrate twice. Do the integration and write the analytic solution (there should be no surprises here).

(b)  To get a numerical solution we first need to partition the domain into finitely many point. For the sake of simplicity let us say that we subdivide the interval into 5 equal sub intervals (so there are 6 points including the endpoints). Furthermore, we know that we can approximate $u_{xx}$ as 
\begin{equation}
 u_{xx} \approx \frac{U_{i+1} - 2U_i + U_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}. 
\end{equation}
 Thus we have 6 linear equations: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} U_0 &= 1 \quad \text{(left boundary condition)}\\ \frac{U_2 - 2U_1 + U_0}{\Delta x^2} &= 0 \\ \frac{U_3 - 2U_2 + U_1}{\Delta x^2} &= 0 \\ \frac{U_4 - 2U_3 + U_2}{\Delta x^2} &= 0 \\ \frac{U_5 - 2U_4 + U_3}{\Delta x^2} &= 0 \\ U_5 &= 0 \quad \text{(right boundary condition).} \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
 Notice that there are really only four unknowns since the boundary conditions dictate two of the temperature values. Rearrange this system of equations into a matrix equation and solve for the unknowns $U_1$, $U_2$, $U_3$, and $U_4$. Your coefficient matrix should be $4 \times 4$.

(c)  Compare your answers from parts (a) and (b).

(d)  Write code to build the numerical solution with an arbitrary value for $\Delta x$ (i.e. an arbitrary number of sub intervals). You should build the linear system automatically in your code.

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Solving the 1D Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions is rather uninteresting since the answer will always be a linear function connecting the two boundary conditions. The Poisson equation $u_{xx} = f(x)$ is more interesting than the Laplace equation in 1D. The function $f(x)$ is called a forcing function. You can think of it this way: if $u$ is the amount of force on a linear bridge, then $f$ might be a function that gives the distribution of the forces on the bridge due to the cars sitting on the bridge. In terms of heat we can think of this as an external source of heat energy warming up the one-dimensional rod somewhere in the middle (like a flame being held to one place on the rod).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.69}
How would we analytically solve the Poisson equation $u_{xx} = f(x)$ in one spatial dimension? As a sample problem consider $x\in [0,1]$, the forcing function $f(x) = 5\sin(2 \pi x)$ and boundary conditions $u(0) = 2$ and $u(1) = 0.5$. Of course you need to check your answer by taking two derivatives and making sure that the second derivative exactly matches $f(x)$. Also be sure that your solution matches the boundary conditions exactly.

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.70}
Now we can solve the Poisson equation from the previous problem numerically. Let us again build this with a partition that contains only 6 points just like we did with the Laplace equation a few exercise ago. We know the approximation for $u_{xx}$ so we have the linear system 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} U_0 &= 2 \quad \text{(left boundary condition)}\\ \frac{U_2 - 2U_1 + U_0}{\Delta x^2} &= f(x_1) \\ \frac{U_3 - 2U_2 + U_1}{\Delta x^2} &= f(x_2) \\ \frac{U_4 - 2U_3 + U_2}{\Delta x^2} &= f(x_3) \\ \frac{U_5 - 2U_4 + U_3}{\Delta x^2} &= f(x_4) \\ U_5 &= 0.5 \quad \text{(right boundary condition).} \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


(a)  Rearrange the system of equations as a matrix equation and then solve the system for $U_1, U_2, U_3$, and $U_4$. There are really only four equations so your matrix should be $4 \times 4$.

(b)  Compare your solution from part (a) to the function values that you found in the previous exercise.

(c)  Now generalize the process of solving the 1D Poisson equation for an arbitrary value of $\Delta x$. You will need to build the matrix and the right-hand side in your code. Test your code on new forcing functions and new boundary conditions.

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-6.71}
The previous exercises only account for Dirichlet boundary conditions (fixed boundary conditions). We would now like to modify our Poisson solution to allow for a Neumann condition: where we know the derivative of $u$ at one of the boundaries. The statement of the problem is as follows: 
\begin{equation}
\text{Solve: } u_{xx} = f(x) \quad \text{on} \quad x \in (0,1) \quad \text{with} \quad u_x(0) = \alpha \quad \text{and} \quad u(1) = \beta.
\end{equation}
 The derivative condition on the boundary can be approximated by using a first-order approximation of the derivative, and as a consequence we have one new equation. Specifically, if we know that $u_x(0) = \alpha$ then we can approximate this condition as 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{U_1 - U_0}{\Delta x} = \alpha, 
\end{equation}
 and we simply need to add this equation to the system that we were solving in the previous exercise. If we go back to our example of a partition with 6 points the system becomes 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} \frac{U_1 - U_0}{\Delta x} &= \alpha \quad \text{(left boundary condition)}\\ \frac{U_2 - 2U_1 + U_0}{\Delta x^2} &= f(x_1) \\ \frac{U_3 - 2U_2 + U_1}{\Delta x^2} &= f(x_2) \\ \frac{U_4 - 2U_3 + U_2}{\Delta x^2} &= f(x_3) \\ \frac{U_5 - 2U_4 + U_3}{\Delta x^2} &= f(x_4) \\ U_5 &= \beta \quad \text{(right boundary condition).} \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
 There are 5 equations this time.

(a)  With a 6 point grid solve the Poisson equation $u_{xx} = 5\sin(2\pi x)$ with $u_x(0) = 0$ and $u(1) = 3$.

(b)  Modify your code from part (a) to solve the same problem but with a much smaller value of $\Delta x$. You will need to build the matrix equation in your code.

#### The 2D Poisson Equation
We conclude this section, and chapter, by examining the two dimensional Poisson equations. As a sample problem, we want to solve the Poisson equation 
$$u_{xx} + u_{yy} = f(x,y)$$
on the domain $(x,y) \in (0,1)\times (0,1)$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and forcing function
$$f(x,y) = -20\text{exp}\left( -\frac{(x-0.5)^2 + (y-0.5)^2}{0.05} \right)$$ 
numerically. 

We are going to start with a $6 \times 6$ grid of points and explicitly write down all of the equations. In @fig-6.14 the red stars represent boundary points where the value of $u(x,y)$ is known and the blue interior points are the ones where $u(x,y)$ is yet unknown. It should be clear that we should have two indices for each point (one for the $x$ position and one for the $y$ position), but it should also be clear that this will cause problems when writing down the resulting system of equations as a matrix equation (stop and think carefully about this). Therefore, in @fig-6.14 we propose an index, $k$, starting at the top left of the unknown nodes and reading left to right (just like we do with Python arrays).

(a)  Start by discretizing the 2D Poisson equation $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = f(x,y)$. For simplicity we assume that $\Delta x = \Delta y$ so that we can combine like terms from the $x$ derivative and the $y$ derivative. Fill in the missing coefficients and indices below. 
\begin{equation}
U_{i+1,j} + U_{i,j-1} - (\underline{\hspace{0.2in}}) U_{\underline{\hspace{0.2in}},\underline{\hspace{0.2in}}} + U_{\underline{\hspace{0.2in}},\underline{\hspace{0.2in}}} + U_{\underline{\hspace{0.2in}},\underline{\hspace{0.2in}}} = \Delta x^2 f(x_i,y_i)
\end{equation}


(b)  In @fig-6.14 we see that there are 16 total equations resulting from the discretization of the Poisson equation. Your first task is to write all 16 of these equations. we will get you started:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} \text{$k=0$: } &\quad U_{k=1} + {\color{red} U_{i=1,j=0} } - 4U_{k=0} + {\color{red} U_{i=0,j=1} } + U_{k=4} = \Delta x^2 f(x_1,y_1) \\ \text{$k=1$: } &\quad U_{k=2} + U_{k=0} - 4U_{k=1} + {\color{red} U_{i=0,j=2} } + U_{k=5} = \Delta x^2 f(x_1,y_2) \\ & \qquad \vdots \\ \text{$k=15$: } &\quad {\color{red} U_{i=4,j=5}} + U_{k=14} - 4 U_{k=15} + U_{k=11} + {\color{red} U_{i=5,j=4}} = \Delta x^2 f(x_4,y_4) \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In this particular example we have homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions so all of the boundary values are zero. If this was not the case then every boundary value would need to be moved to the right-hand sides of the equations. 

(c)  We now have a $16 \times 16$ matrix equation to write based on the equations from part (b). Each row and column of the matrix equation is indexed by $k$. The coefficient matrix $A$ is started for you below. Write the whole thing out and fill in the blanks. Notice that this matrix has a much more complicated structure than the coefficient matrix in the 1D Poisson and Laplace equations.
\begin{equation}
A = \begin{pmatrix} -4 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 1 & -4 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -4 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -4 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & & \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \ddots & \\ 0 & & & & & & & & & \\ \vdots & & & & & & & & & \\ & & & & & & & & & \\ & & & & & & & & & -4 \\ \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}


(d)  In the coefficient matrix from part (c) notice that the small matrix 
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} -4 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & -4 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -4 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -4 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
 shows up in blocks along the main diagonal. If you have a hard copy of the matrix go back and draw a box around these blocks in the coefficient matrix. Also notice that there are diagonal bands of $1^s$. Discuss the following:

  1. Why are the blocks $4 \times 4$?

  2. How could you have predicted the location of the diagonal bands of $1^s$?

  3. What would the structure of the matrix look like if we partitioned the domain into a $10 \times 10$ grid of points instead of a $6 \times 6$ grid (including the boundary points)?

  4. Why is it helpful to notice this structure?

(e)  The right-hand side of the matrix equation resulting the your system of equations from part (b) is 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{b} = \Delta x^2 \begin{pmatrix} f(x_1,y_1) \\ f(x_1,y_2) \\ f(x_1,y_3) \\ f(x_1,y_4) \\ f(x_2,y_1) \\ f(x_2,y_2) \\ \vdots \\ \\ f(x_4,y_y) \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
 Notice the structure of this vector. Why is it structured this way? Why is it useful to notice this?

(f)  Write Python code to solve the problem at hand. Recall that $f(x,y) = -20\exp\left(-\frac{-(x-0.5)^2+(y-0.5)^2}{0.05}\right)$. Show a contour plot of your solution. This will take a little work changing the indices back from $k$ to $i$ and $j$. Think carefully about how you want to code this before you put fingers to keyboard. You might want to use the `np.block()` command to build the coefficient matrix efficiently or you can use loops with carefully chosen indices.

(g)  (Challenge) Generalize your code to solve the Poisson equation with a much smaller value of $\Delta x = \Delta y$.

(h)  One more significant observation should be made about the 2D Poisson equation on this square domain. Notice that the corner points of the domain (e.g. $i=0, j=0$ or $i=5, j=0$) are never included in the system of equations. What does this mean about trying to enforce boundary conditions that only apply at the corners?

## Problems

::: {#exr-6.85}
In this problem we will solve a more realistic 1D heat equation. We will allow the diffusivity to change spatially, so $D = D(x)$ and we want to solve 
\begin{equation}
u_t = \left( D(x) u_x \right)_x
\end{equation}
 on $x \in (0,1)$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(t,0) = u(t,1) = 0$ and initial condition $u(0,x) = \sin(2 \pi x)$. This is "more realistic" since it would be rare to have a perfectly homogeneous medium, and the function $D$ reflects any heterogeneities in the way the diffusion occurs. In this problem we will take $D(x)$ to be the parabola $D(x)= x^3(1-x)$. We start by doing some calculus to rewrite the differential equation: 
\begin{equation}
u_t = D(x) u_{xx}(x) + D'(x) u_x(x).
\end{equation}


Your jobs are:

1.  Describe what this choice of $D(x)$ might mean physically in the heat equation.

2.  Write an explicit scheme to solve this problem by using centred differences for the spatial derivatives and an Euler-type discretization for the temporal derivative. Write a clear and thorough explanation for how you are doing the discretization as well as a discussion for the errors that are being made with each discretization.

3.  Write a script to find an approximate solution to this problem.

4.  Write a clear and thorough discussion about how your will choose $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ to give stable solutions to this equation.

5.  Graphically compare your solution to this problem with a heat equation where $D$ is taken to be the constant average diffusivity found by calculating $D_{ave} = \int_0^1 D(x) dx.$ How does the changing diffusivity change the shape of the solution?

The explicit finite difference scheme that we built for the 1D heat equation in this chapter has error on the order of $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t) + \mathcal{O}(\Delta x^2)$. Explain clearly what this means. Then devise a numerical experiment to empirically test this fact. Clearly explain your thought process and show sufficient plots and mathematics to support your work.

Suppose that we have a concrete slab that is 10 meters in length, with the left boundary held at a temperature of $75^\circ$ and the right boundary held at a temperature of $90^\circ$. Assume that the thermal diffusivity of concrete is about $k = 10^{-5}$ m$^2$/s. Assume that the initial temperature of the slab is given by the function $T(x) = 75 + 1.5x - 20 \sin( \pi x / 10)$. In this case, the temperature can be analytically solved by the function $T(t,x) = 75 + 1.5x - 20 \sin(\pi x / 10) e^{-ct}$ for some value of $c$.

1.  Working by hand (no computers!) test the proposed analytic solution by substituting it into the 1D heat equation and verifying that it is indeed a solution. In doing so you will be able to find the correct value of $c$.

2.  Write numerical code to solve this 1D heat equation. The output of your code should be an animation showing how the error between the numerical solution and the analytic solution evolve in time.

(This problem is modified from [@Spayd]). The data given below is real experimental data provided courtesy of the authors.)

Harry and Sally set up an experiment to gather data specifically for the heat diffusion through a long thin metal rod. Their experimental setup was as follows.

-   The ends of the rod are submerged in water baths at different temperatures and the heat from the hot water bath (on the right hand side) travels through the metal to the cooler end (on the left hand side).

-   The temperature of the rod is measured at four locations; those measurements are sent to a Raspberry Pi, which processes the raw data and sends the collated data to be displayed on the computer screen.

-   They used a metal rod of length $L = 300 mm$ and square cross-sectional width $3.2 mm$.

-   The temperature sensors were placed at $x_1 = 47mm$, $x_2 = 94mm$, $x_3 = 141mm$, and $x_4 = 188mm$ as measured from the cool end (the left end).

-   Foam tubing, with a thickness of 25 mm, was wrapped around the rod and sensors to provide some insulation.

-   The ambient temperature in the room was $22^\circ C$ and the cool water bath is a large enough reservoir that the left side of the rod is kept at $22^\circ C$.

The data table below gives temperature measurements at 60 second intervals for each of the four sensors.

1.  At time time $t=960$ seconds the temperatures of the rod are essentially at a steady state. Use this data to make a prediction of the temperature of the hot water bath located at $x=300mm$.

2.  The thermal diffusivity, $D$, of the metal is unknown. Use your numerical solution in conjunction with the data to approximate the value of $D$. Be sure to fully defend your process.

3.  It is unlikely that your numerical solution to the heat equation and the data from part 2 match very well. What are some sources of error in the data or in the heat equation model?

You can load the data directly with the following code.

``` python         
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
URL = 'https://github.com/gustavdelius/NumericalAnalysis2024/raw/main/data/PDE/'
data = np.array(pd.read_csv(URL+'1dheatdata.csv'))

You may recall from your differential equations class that population growth under limited resources is governed by the logistic equation $x' = k_1x(1-x/k_2)$ where $x=x(t)$ is the population, $k_1$ is the intrinsic growth rate of the population, and $k_2$ is the carrying capacity of the population. The carrying capacity is the maximum population that can be supported by the environment. The trouble with this model is that the species is presumed to be fixed to a spatial location. Let us make a modification to this model that allows the species to spread out over time while they reproduce. We have seen throughout this chapter that the heat equation $u_t = D(u_{xx} + u_{yy})$ models the diffusion of a substance (like heat or concentration). We therefore propose the model\

\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k_1 u \left( 1 - \frac{u}{k_2} \right) + D \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right) 
\end{equation}
 where $u(t,x,y)$ is the population density of the species at time $t$ and spatial point $(x,y)$, $(x,y)$ is a point in some square spatial domain, $k_1$ is the growth rate of the population, $k_2$ is the carrying capacity of the population, and $D$ is the rate of diffusion. Develop a finite difference scheme to solve this PDE. Experiment with this model showing the interplay between the parameters $D$, $k_1$, and $k_2$. Take an initial condition of 
\begin{equation}
 u(0,x,y) = e^{-( (x-0.5)^2 + (y-0.5)^2)/0.05}. 
\end{equation}

In @exr-6.72 you solved the Poisson equation, $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = f(x,y)$, on the unit square with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and a forcing function $f(x,y) = -20 \exp\left(-\frac{(x-0.5)^2 + (y-0.5)^2}{0.05} \right)$. Use a $10 \times 10$ grid of points to solve the Poisson equation on the same domain with the same forcing function but with boundary conditions 
\begin{equation}
u(0,y)=0, \quad u(1,y) = 0, \quad u(x,0) = -\sin(\pi x), \quad u(x,1) = 0.
\end{equation}
 Show a contour plot of your solution.

## Projects

In this section we propose several ideas for projects related to numerical partial differential equations. These projects are meant to be open ended, to encourage creative mathematics, to push your coding skills, and to require you to write and communicate your mathematics.

### Hunting and Diffusion

Let $u$ be a function modelling a mobile population in an environment where it has an intrinsic growth rate of $r$ and a carrying capacity of $K$. If we were only worried about the size of the population we could solve the differential equation 
\begin{equation}
\frac{du}{dt} = ru \left( 1-\frac{u}{K} \right),
\end{equation}
 but there is more to the story.

Hunters harvest the population at a per-capita rate $h$ so we can append the differential equation with the harvesting term $-h u$ to arrive at the ordinary differential equation 
\begin{equation}
\frac{du}{dt} = ru \left( 1-\frac{u}{K} \right) - hu.
\end{equation}

Since the population is mobile let us make a few assumptions about the environment that they are in and how the individuals move.

-   The growing conditions for the population are the same everywhere

-   Individuals move around randomly.

Clearly these assumptions imply that our model is a simplification of real populations and real environments, but let us go with it for now. Given the nature of these assumptions we assume that a diffusion term models the spread of the individuals in the population. Hence, the PDE model is 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = ru\left( 1-\frac{u}{K} \right) - hu + D \left( u_{xx} + u_{yy} \right).
\end{equation}


1.  Use any of your ODE codes to solve the ordinary differential equation with harvesting. Give a complete description of the parameter space.

2.  Write code to solve the spatial+temporal PDE equation on the 2D domain $(x,y) \in [0,1] \times [0,1]$. Choose an appropriate initial condition and choose appropriate boundary conditions.

3.  The third assumption is not necessary true for rough terrain. The true form of the spatial component of the differential equation is $\nabla \cdot \left( D(x,y) \nabla u \right)$ where $D(x,y)$ is a multivariable function dictating the ease of diffusion in different spatial locations. Propose a (non-negative) function $D(x,y)$ and repeat part 2 with this new diffusion term.

### Heating Adobe Houses

Adobe houses, typically built in desert climates, are known for their great thermal efficiency. The heat equation 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{c_p \rho} \left( T_{xx} + T_{yy} + T_{zz} \right),
\end{equation}
 where $c_p$ is the specific heat of the adobe, $\rho$ is the mass density of the adobe, and $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the adobe, can be used to model the heat transfer through the adobe from the outside of the house to the inside. Clearly, the thicker the adobe walls the better, but there is a trade off to be considered:

-   it would be prohibitively expensive to build walls so think that the inside temperature was (nearly) constant, and

-   if the walls are too thin then the cost is low but the temperature inside has a large amount of variability.

Your Tasks:

1.  Pick a desert location in the southwestern US (New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, or Southern California) and find some basic temperature data to model the outside temperature during typical summer and winter months.

2.  Do some research on the cost of building adobe walls and find approximations for the parameters in the heat equation.

3.  Use a numerical model to find the optimal thickness of an adobe wall. Be sure to fully describe your criteria for optimality, the initial and boundary conditions used, and any other simplifying assumptions needed for your model.
