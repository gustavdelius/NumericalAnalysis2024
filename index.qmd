# Introduction {.unnumbered}

> *What I cannot create, I do not understand.*\

Mathematics is not just an abstract pursuit; it is an essential tool that powers a vast array of applications. From weather forecasting to black hole simulations, from urban planning to medical research, the application of mathematics has become indispensable. Central to this applied force is Numerical Analysis.

## What Is Numerical Analysis?

Numerical Analysis is the discipline that bridges continuous mathematical theories with their concrete implementation on digital computers. These computers, by design, work with discrete quantities, and translating continuous problems into this discrete realm is not always straightforward.

In this module, we will explore the key techniques, algorithms, and principles of Numerical Analysis that enable us to translate mathematical problems into computational solutions. We will delve into the challenges that arise in this translation, the strategies to overcome them, and the interaction of theory and practice.

Many mathematical problems cannot be solved analytically in closed form. In Numerical Analysis, we aim to find *approximation algorithms* for mathematical problems, i.e., schemes that allow us to compute the solution approximately. These algorithms use only elementary operations ($+,-,\times,/$) but often a long sequence of them, so that in practice they need to be run on computers.to

### Example from Algebra

Solve the equation $\log(x) = \sin(x)$ for $x$ in the interval $x \in (0,\pi)$. Stop and think about all of the algebra that you ever learned. you will quickly realize that there are no by-hand techniques that can solve this problem! A numerical approximation, however, is not so hard to come by. The following graph shows that there is a unique solution to this equation in the interval $(0,\pi)$.

```{python}
#| label: fig-lnsin
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-cap: The functions $\log(x)$ and $\sin(x)$ intersect at exactly one point, giving the solution to the equation $\log(x) = \sin(x)$.
#| column: page-right
# plot the function cos(x) and the line y=x
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
x = np.linspace(1, 4, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.log(x), label="log(x)")
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x), label="sin(x)")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Example from Calculus

What if we want to evaluate 

$$
    \int_0^\pi \sin(x^2) dx?
$$
    
```{python}
#| label: fig-int_sin_x_squared
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-cap: Visual representation of the integral of $\sin(x^2)$ from $0$ to $\pi$.
#| column: page-right
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return np.sin(x**2)

a = 0
b = np.pi
n = 1000  # Number of points for numerical integration

x = np.linspace(a, b, n)
y = f(x)

# Calculate the numerical integral using the trapezoidal rule
integral = np.trapz(y, x)

# Shade the positive and negative regions differently
plt.fill_between(x, y, where=y>=0, color='green', alpha=0.5, label="Positive")
plt.fill_between(x, y, where=y<0, color='red', alpha=0.5, label="Negative")

# Plot the curve
plt.plot(x, y, color='black', label=r"sin(x^2)")

# Set labels and title
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.title("Integral of sin(x^2) from 0 to pi")

# Add legend
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
    
Again, trying to use any of the possible techniques for using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and hence finding an antiderivative, on the function $\sin(x^2)$ is completely hopeless. Substitution, integration by parts, and all of the other techniques that you know will all fail. Again, a numerical approximation is not so difficult and is very fast and gives the value

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
# Use Simpson's rule to approximate the integral of sin(x^2) from 0 to pi
from scipy.integrate import simpson
simpson(y, x = x)
```
    
By the way, this integral (called the [Fresnel Sine Integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_integral)) actually shows up naturally in the field of optics and electromagnetism, so it is not just some arbitrary integral that I cooked up just for fun.

### Example from Linear Algebra

You have probably never row reduced a matrix larger than $3\times 3$ or perhaps $4 \times 4$ by hand. Instead, you often turn to technology to do the row reduction for you. You would be surprised to find that the standard row reduction algorithm (RREF) that you do by hand is not what a computer uses. Instead, there are efficient algorithms to do the basic operations of linear algebra (e.g. Gaussian elimination, matrix factorization, or eigenvalue decomposition)


### Example from Differential Equations

Say we needed to solve the differential equation

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = \sin(y^2) + t.$$


The nonlinear nature of the problem precludes us from using most of the typical techniques (e.g. separation of variables, undetermined coefficients, Laplace Transforms, etc). However, computational methods that result in a plot of an approximate solution can be made very quickly and likely give enough of a solution to be usable. Here is a plot of the solution up to time $t=2.5$ with initial condition $y(0)=0.1$:
```{python}
#| label: fig-diffeq
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-cap: Plot of numerical solution of $dy/dt=\sin(y^2)+t$ with $y(0)=0.1$.
#| column: page-right
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

def f(t, y):
    return np.sin(y**2) + t

# Initial condition
y0 = 0.1

# Time span for the solution
t_span = (0, 2.5)

# Solve the differential equation using SciPy's solver
sol = solve_ivp(f, t_span, [y0], max_step=0.1, dense_output=True)

# Extract the time values and solution
t = sol.t
y = sol.sol(t)[0]  

# Plot the numerical solution
plt.plot(t, y)

# Labels and title
plt.xlabel('t')
plt.ylabel('y')

# Show the plot
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This was an artificial example, but differential equations are central to modelling the real world in order to predict the future. They are the closest thing we have to a crystal ball. Here is a plot of a numerical solution of the SIR model of the evolution of an epidemic over time:
```{python}
#| label: fig-SIRintro
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-cap: Plot of a numerical solution of the SIR model
#| column: page-right
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# SIR model differential equations
def sir_model(y, t, N, beta, gamma):
    S, I, R = y
    dSdt = -beta * S * I / N
    dIdt = beta * S * I / N - gamma * I
    dRdt = gamma * I
    return dSdt, dIdt, dRdt

# Total population, N
N = 1000
# Initial number of infected and recovered individuals
I0, R0 = 1, 0
# Everyone else is susceptible to infection initially
S0 = N - I0 - R0
# Contact rate, beta, and mean recovery rate, gamma, (in 1/days)
beta, gamma = 0.25, 1./20 
# A grid of time points (in days)
t = np.linspace(0, 160, 160)

# Initial conditions vector
y0 = S0, I0, R0
# Integrate the SIR equations over the time grid, t
ret = odeint(sir_model, y0, t, args=(N, beta, gamma))
S, I, R = ret.T

# Plot the data on three separate curves for S(t), I(t) and R(t)
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(t, S, 'b', alpha=0.7, linewidth=2, label='Susceptible')
plt.plot(t, I, 'y', alpha=0.7, linewidth=2, label='Infected')
plt.plot(t, R, 'g', alpha=0.7, linewidth=2, label='Recovered')
plt.xlabel('Time /days')
plt.ylabel('Number (1000s)')
plt.ylim(0, N)
plt.title('SIR Model Simulation')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```


### Reasons to study Numerical Analysis

So why should you want to venture into Numerical Analysis rather than just use the computer as a black box?

1.  **Precision and Stability:** Computers, despite their power, can introduce significant errors if mathematical problems are implemented without care. Numerical Analysis offers techniques to ensure we obtain results that are both accurate and stable.

2.  **Efficiency:** Real-world applications often demand not just correctness, but efficiency. By grasping the methods of Numerical Analysis, we can design algorithms that are both accurate and resource-efficient.

3.  **Broad Applications:** Whether your interest lies in physics, engineering, biology, finance, or many other scientific fields, Numerical Analysis provides the computational tools to tackle complex problems in these areas.

4.  **Basis for Modern Technologies:** Core principles of Numerical Analysis are foundational in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and data science.

The prerequisites for this material include a firm understanding of single variable calculus (though multivariable calculus does not hurt), a good understanding of the basics of linear algebra, a good understanding of the basics of differential equations, and some exposure to scientific computing.

By the end, you will not merely understand the methods of Numerical Analysis; you will be equipped to apply them efficiently and effectively in diverse scenarios: you will be able to tackle problems in physics, engineering, biology, finance, and many other fields; you will be able to design algorithms that are both accurate and resource-efficient; you will be able to ensure that your computational solutions are both accurate and stable; you will be able to leverage the power of computers to solve complex problems.

## The Inquiry-Based Approach

This material is written with an Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) flavor. In that sense, these notes are not a *traditional textbook* containing all of the expected theorems, proofs, code, examples, and exposition. You are encouraged to work through exercises, problems and projects, present your findings, and work together when appropriate.

In our first session we will start off right away with an exercise designed for groups, discussion, disagreement, and deep critical thinking. This exercise is inspired by Dana Ernst's first day IBL activity titled: [Setting the Stage](http://danaernst.com/setting-the-stage/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#exr-0.1}
-   Get in groups of size 3-4.
-   Group members should introduce themselves.
-   For each of the questions that follow I will ask you to:

1.  **Think** about a possible answer on your own

2.  **Discuss** your answers with the rest of the group

3.  **Share** a summary of each group's discussion

**Questions:**

Question 1: What are the goals of a university education?

Question 2: How does a person learn something new?

Question 3: What do you reasonably expect to remember from your courses in 20 years?

Question 4: What is the value of making mistakes in the learning process?

Question 5: How do we create a safe environment where risk taking is encouraged and productive failure is valued?

## How this module works

There are 4 one-hour **whole-class sessions** every week. Three of these are listed on your timetable as "Lecture" and one as "Computer Practical". However, in all these sessions you, the student, are the one that is doing the work; discovering methods, writing code, working problems, leading discussions, and pushing the pace. I, the lecturer, will act as a guide who only steps in to redirect conversations or to provide necessary insight. You will use the whole-class sessions to share and discuss your work with the other members of your group. There will also be some whole-class discussions moderated by your lecturer.

You will find that this text is not a set of lecture notes. Instead it mostly just contains collections of exercises with minimal interweaving exposition. It is expected that you **do every one of the exercises** in the main body of each chapter and use the sequencing of the exercises to guide your learning and understanding. 

Therefore the whole-class sessions form only a very small part of your work on this module. For each hour of whole-class work you should timetable yourself about two and a half hours of **work outside class** for working through the exercises on your own. I strongly recommend that you put those two and a half hours (ten hours spread throughout the week) into your timetable. Of course I hope that your explorations will be so satisfying that you will want to spend more than those ten hours every week. This is a module where you will develop amazing skills that it will be fun to exploit in your own investigations. Your lecturer will be very interested to hear about your experiences.

At the end of each chapter there is a section entitled "**Problems**" that contains additional exercises aimed at consolidating your new understanding and skills. Of these you should aim to do as many as you can but you will not have time to do them all. As the module progresses I will give advice on which of those problems to attack. There are no traditional problem sheets in this module. In this module you will be working on exercises continuously throughout the week rather than working through a problem sheet only every other week.

Many of the chapters also have a section entitled "**Projects**". These projects are more open-ended investigations, designed to encourage creative mathematics, to push your coding skills and to require you to write and communicate mathematics. These projects are entirely optional and perhaps you will like to return to one of these even after the module has finished. If you do work on one of the projects, be sure to share your work with your lecturer at [gustav.delius@york.ac.uk](mailto:gustav.delius@york.ac.uk) who will be very interested, also after the end of the module.

You will need two **notebooks** for working through the exercises in this guide: one in paper form and one electronic. Some of the exercises are pen-and-paper exercises while others are coding exercises and some require both writing or sketching and coding. The two notebooks will be linked through the numbering of the exercises.

For the coding notebook I highly recommend using **Google Colab** (or Jupyter Notebook). This will be discussed more in @sec-python that introduces Python. Most students find it easiest to have one dedicated Colab notebook (or Jupyter notebook) per section, but some students will want to have one per chapter. You are highly encouraged to write explanatory text into your Google Colab notebooks as you go so that future-you can tell what it is that you were doing, which problem(s) you were solving, and what your thought processes were. 

In the end, your collection of notebooks will contain solutions to every exercise in the guide and can serve as a reference manual for future numerical analysis problems.
At the end of each of your notebooks you may also want to add a summary of what you have learned, which will both consolidate your learning and make it easier for you to remind yourself of your new skills later.

One request: do not share your notebooks publicly on the internet because that would create temptation for future students to not put in the work themselves, thereby robbing them of the learning experience.

If you have a **notebook computer**, bring it along to the class sessions. However this is not a requirement. Your lecturer will bring along some spare machines to make sure that every group has at least one computer to use during every session. The only requirement for a computer to be useful for this module is that it can connect to the campus WiFi and run a web browser. The "Computer Practical" takes place in a PC classroom, so there will of course be plenty of machines available then.

## Assessment

Unfortunately, your learning in the module also needs to be assessed. The final mark will be made up of 40% coursework and 60% final exam. 

The **40\% coursework** mark will come from 10 short quizzes that will take place during the "Computer practical" in weeks 2 to 11. Answering each quiz should take less than 5 minutes but you will be given 10 minutes to complete it to give you a large safety margin and remove stress. The quizzes will be based on exercises that you will already have worked through and for which you will have had time to discuss them in class, so they will be really easy if you have engaged with the exercises as intended. Each quiz will be worth 5 points. There will be a practice quiz in the computer practical in week 1 and another one at the start of the practical in week 2.

During the assessment quizzes you will be required to work exclusively on a classroom PC rather than your own machine. You will do your work in a Colab notebook that will be shared with you at the start of the quiz via Moodle. You will then need to save your work, download the Colab notebook to the PC and upload it to Moodle before the end of the quiz. You can find more info on the use of [Colab notebooks](nmPython.qmd#google-colab) in this module in the [Essential Python](nmPython.qmd) chapter of the Numerical Analysis Learning Guide. 

While working on the quiz on the classroom PC you are only allowed to use a web browser, and the only pages you are allowed to have open are this guide, the course home page on Moodle and any of your notebooks on Google Colab. You are not allowed to use any AI assistants or other web pages. Besides your online notebooks you may also use any hand-written notes as long as you have written them yourself.

Late submissions will be accepted until 5 minutes after the deadline but there will be one penalty point deduction for a late submission. Submissions that are more than 5 minutes late will get 0 points.

To allow for the fact that there may be weeks in which you are ill or otherwise prevented from performing to your best in the assessment quizzes, your final coursework mark will be calculated as the average over your 8 best marks. If exceptional circumstances affect more than two of the 10 quizzes then you would need to submit an exceptional circumstances claim.

The **60\% final exam** will be a 2 hour exam of the usual closed-book form in an exam room during the exam period. I will make a practice exam available at the end of the module. 

## Textbooks

In this module we will only scratch the surface of the vast subject that is Numerical Analysis. The aim is for you at the end of this module to be familiar with some key ideas and to have the confidence to engage with new methods when they become relevant to you. 

There are many textbooks on Numerical Analysis. Standard textbooks are [@Burden_Faires] and [@Kincaid]. They contain much of the material from this module. A less structured and more opinionated account can be found in [@Acton].
Another well known reference that researchers often turn to for solutions to specific tasks is [@Press]. You will find many others in the library. They may go also under alternative names like Numerical Methods or Scientific Computing. 

You may also want to look at textbooks for specific topics covered in this module, like for example [@Butcher] for methods for ordinary differential equations.

## Your jobs

You have the following jobs as a student in this module:

1.  **Fight!** You will have to fight hard to work through this material. The fight is exactly what we are after since it is ultimately what leads to innovative thinking.

2.  **Screw Up!** More accurately, do not be afraid to screw up. You should write code, work problems, and develop methods, then be completely unafraid to scrap what you have done and redo it from scratch.

3.  **Collaborate!** You should collaborate with your peers with the following caveats:

    a.  When you are done collaborating you should go your separate ways. When you write your solution you should have no written (or digital) record of your collaboration.

    b.  Use of the internet or AI to help solve these problems robs you of the most important part of this module; the chance for original thought.

4.  **Enjoy!** Part of the fun of inquiry-based learning is that you get to experience what it is like to think like a true mathematician / scientist. It takes hard work but ultimately this should be fun!
