	isbn = {978-0-88385-450-1},
	abstract = {Numerical Methods that Work, originally published in 1970, has been reissued by the MAA with a new preface and some additional problems. Acton deals with a commonsense approach to numerical algorithms for the solution of equations: algebraic, transcendental, and differential. He assumes that a computer is available for performing the bulk of the arithmetic. The book is divided into two parts, either of which could form the basis of a one-semester course in numerical methods. Part I discusses most of the standard techniques: roots of transcendental equations, roots of polynomials, eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, and so on. Part II cuts across the basic tools, stressing such commonplace problems as extrapolation, removal of singularities, and loss of significant figures. The book is written with clarity and precision, intended for practical rather than theoretical use. This book will interest mathematicians, both pure and applied, as well as any scientist or engineer working with numerical problems.},

In the {HTML} version, more than 250 of the exercises are available as interactive {WeBWorK} exercises; students will love that the online version even looks great on a smart phone. Each section of Active Calculus has at least 4 in-class activities to engage students in active learning. Normally, each section has a brief introduction together with a preview activity, followed by a mix of exposition and several more activities. Each section concludes with a short summary and exercises; the non-{WeBWorK} exercises are typically involved and challenging. More information on the goals and structure of the text can be found in the preface.},

Designed for upper-division undergraduates in mathematics or computer science classes, the textbook assumes that students have prior knowledge of linear algebra and calculus, although these topics are reviewed in the text. Short discussions of the history of numerical methods are interspersed throughout the chapters. The book also includes polynomial interpolation at Chebyshev points, use of the {MATLAB} package Chebfun, and a section on the fast Fourier transform.

With mathematical modeling growing rapidly in so many scientific and technical disciplines, Mathematical Modeling, Fourth Edition provides a rigorous treatment of the subject.
